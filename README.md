Instructions
Write one or two paragraphs for your project idea.  The proposal is not graded, but just a place to try to give you feedback.  There is no commitment to the project you propose.  You can change it after this.

Your description should try to describe what you will attempt to do and where you are going to get data.  State any references / other code that you will build on.  Also, if you have an idea of how you will approach the problem state that here.

You may build on other stuff you find on the web.  But, you MUST cite it and say what you did to modify it.  Taking any material (text or code) from others without citation will be considered plagiarism.
All projects MUST have between 2 and 4 members.
Only one person per group should submit.  List the group members in the submission.
